# Go2Rust Implementation Roadmap

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Hello World

Basic program transpilation

### ✅ Phase 2: Variables and Basic Types

Variables, basic types, maps, nil, interface{}, type assertions, control flow

### ✅ Phase 3: Pointers and Mutation

Pointer types, &/*, new() builtin, struct fields, nil handling

### ✅ Phase 4: Functions and Methods

Method receivers (value and pointer), multiple returns, method calls

### 🚧 Phase 4.5: Advanced Types and Structs (85% Complete)

- ✅ Type aliases (`type A = B`) - generates proper Rust type aliases
- ✅ Type definitions (`type A B`) - generates newtype wrappers with Display impl
- ✅ Struct tags - preserved as comments in generated code
- 🚧 Struct embedding - method promotion working, field promotion needs wrapper handling fixes
- 🚧 Anonymous structs - partial support (type generation works, literals need fixing)

### 📋 Phase 5: Core Language Features (60% Complete)

- ✅ Basic constants - simple const declarations working
- 🚧 Complex constants and iota - expressions, iota patterns need work
- ✅ Closures and function literals - fully working with proper variable capture
- ✅ Defer statements - fully working with proper LIFO execution and variable capture
- ❌ Panic and recover - not implemented
- 🚧 Interfaces - empty interface{} support added, named interfaces incomplete

### 📋 Phase 6: Control Flow Extensions

- ❌ Select statements (select_basic, select_statements)
- ❌ Goto and labels (goto_labels, labeled_statements)
- ❌ Fallthrough in switch (fallthrough_switch)
- ✅ Blank identifier - fully working except for channels (which aren't implemented)

### 📋 Phase 7: Goroutines and Concurrency

go → thread::spawn, channels, sync primitives

### 📋 Phase 8: Package System

- Multiple file packages (package_multiple_files)
- Init functions (init_functions, init_order_complex)
- Import side effects (blank_imports_side_effects)
- Standard library imports (stdlib_imports)

### 📋 Phase 9: Advanced Features (Optional/Future)

- Generics (generics_basic)
- Reflection (struct_tags_reflection)
- Unsafe operations (unsafe_pointer_ops)
- JSON/encoding support

### 🚀 Phase 10: Bootstrap Test

go2rust transpiles itself!
