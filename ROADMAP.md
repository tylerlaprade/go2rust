# Go2Rust Implementation Roadmap

## Implementation Status

**Current Progress: 47/132 tests passing (35.6%)**
*Last updated: 2025-08-24*

### ✅ Phase 1: Hello World

Basic program transpilation

### ✅ Phase 2: Variables and Basic Types

Variables, basic types, maps, nil, interface{}, type assertions, control flow

### ✅ Phase 3: Pointers and Mutation

Pointer types, &/*, new() builtin, struct fields, nil handling

### ✅ Phase 4: Functions and Methods

Method receivers (value and pointer), multiple returns, method calls

### ✅ Phase 4.5: Advanced Types and Structs

Type aliases/definitions, struct tags, embedding, anonymous structs, nested field access

### 🚧 Phase 5: Core Language Features (85% Complete)

- ✅ Basic constants - simple const declarations working
- ✅ Complex constants and iota - multiple constants per line, bit shifts, blank identifier all working (2025-08-23)
- ✅ Closures and function literals - fully working with proper variable capture
- ✅ Defer statements - fully working with proper LIFO execution and variable capture
- ❌ Panic and recover - partially implemented, needs catch_unwind integration
- 🚧 Interfaces - empty interface{} working with proper initialization and formatting (2025-08-24), named interfaces need boxing support

### 📋 Phase 6: Control Flow Extensions

- ❌ Select statements (select_basic, select_statements)
- ❌ Goto and labels (goto_labels, labeled_statements)
- ❌ Fallthrough in switch (fallthrough_switch)
- ✅ Blank identifier - fully working except for channels (which aren't implemented)

### 📋 Phase 7: Goroutines and Concurrency

go → thread::spawn, channels, sync primitives

### 📋 Phase 8: Package System

- Multiple file packages (package_multiple_files)
- Init functions (init_functions, init_order_complex)
- Import side effects (blank_imports_side_effects)
- Standard library imports (stdlib_imports)

### 📋 Phase 9: Advanced Features (Optional/Future)

- Generics (generics_basic)
- Reflection (struct_tags_reflection)
- Unsafe operations (unsafe_pointer_ops)
- JSON/encoding support

### 🚀 Phase 10: Bootstrap Test

go2rust transpiles itself!
