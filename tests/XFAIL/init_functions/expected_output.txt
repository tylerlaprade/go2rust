First init function called
Second init function called
Third init function called
Global counter initialized to: 15
Fourth init function called
Computed value is: 84
Fifth init function - initializing app config

Configuration loaded with 4 entries

=== Main function started ===
Global counter: 15
Initialized flag: true
Computed value: 94

Configuration data:
  version: 1.0
  author: go2rust
  build: debug
  target: rust

App config: {Name:Go2Rust Transpiler Version:0.1.0 Debug:true}

=== Calling functions that were used in init ===
Computing initial value during package initialization
Calling computeInitialValue() again: 84
Setting up logging system...
Global counter still: 15
Modified global counter: 100

=== Demonstrating init execution order ===
1. Package-level variable declarations
2. Package-level variable initializations (like computedValue)
3. Init functions in the order they appear in source
4. Main function
